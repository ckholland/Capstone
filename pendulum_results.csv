सी बातें की जा रही है इस वक्त पर्स मंज़र के अंदर 48 घंटे के टेंपरेचर इस fire के बावजूद बहुत सी चीज़ें ऐसी चल रही है जो के इंतहाई अहम् है दोस्त मालिक सुला करवाने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं लेकिन इसके साथ ही इस वक्त ground के अंदर Pakistan के लिए बहुत सी मुश्किलात पैदा हो चुकी है और कहा ये जा रहा है की अगर अफ़ग़ानिस्तान और Pakistan की ये जंग ना होती तो अच्छा होता लेकिन सूरतियाल इसके बिल्कुल ही मुख्तलिफ है हम ये देख रहे हैं की Pakistan को Afghanistan के ऊपर क्या advantage हैं इस वक्त Afghanistan के अंदर अफगान तालिबान किस मुश्किल में फैंस हुए हैं और Pakistan गुजिस्टा 70 साल के अंदर Afghanistan में किन हालात में फंसा हुआ है भारत क्या कर रहा है इस वक्त जो जिगर दोस्त मालिक है चीज़ समेत वह पर्स मंज़र के अंदर क्या कोशिश कर रहे हैं कि इस वक्त कहां पर खड़ा है और इसके साथ ही अफगान महाजन और trade के हवाले से भी बहुत ही गलत खबरें हमारे पास ए रही है देखिए Pakistan के लिए ये यकीनी तौर पे एक मुश्किल वक्त है ताल बाद जिन्हें Pakistan ने 30 साल पाल पोस यहां तक की जब America यहां पर ए गया तो Pakistan ने America की हिमायत याफ्ता हुकूमत को तस्लीम किया लेकिन उसके बावजूद वो अफगान तालबान को इस उम्मीद में फैलने फूलने दिया उन्होंने की शायद अफ़ग़ानिस्तान से Pakistan को कोई खतरा मुस्तकबिल के अंदर ना हो मगर वही हुआ जिसका डर था हम ये देख रहे हैं की इस वक्त कहने वाले बहुत सी बातें कर रहे हैं की ये नहीं होना चाहिए था लेकिन इस वक्त सूरते हाल ये है की 2025 के पहले नौ माह के अंदर 2500 लोग शाहिद हो चुके हैं Pakistan के अंदर और 2024 के पूरे साल के अंदर भी 2500 लोग शाहिद हो चुके हैं अब बातें बड़ी की जा रही है दोनों मो मालिक चाहे वो Afghanistan है या Pakistan है इस वक्त फतेह के नारे लगा रहे हैं लेकिन इस वक्त ground के ऊपर क्या सूरतियाल है देखें Pakistan को इस वक्त बहुत से challenge का सामना है एक मगर भी सरहद पे अफ़ग़ानिस्तान का मांस गरम है दूसरा मशहूर की सरहद पर भारत महास को गम करने के लिए तैयार बैठा हुआ है economics Pakistan के इस वक्त डगमगा रही है इसके साथ ही हमें देख रहे हैं की climate और flood hazards जो है वो Pakistan के अंदर तबाही मचा रहे हैं और पॉलिटिकल ट्रबल के बारे में मुझे आपको बताने की ज़रूरत नहीं है की इस वक्त Pakistan के अंदर कितना सियासी ad में इससे कम है इसी हवाले से जब हम आगे चीज़ों को लेके चलते हैं तो हमें ये पता चलता है की वहां तो अफगान तालिबान इस जॉन में बैठे हैं की उन्होंने Mumbai ना तौर पे एक आदमी ताकत को शकीस्त दी है इसलिए अब उनके लिए Pakistan कोई बड़ा मसाला नहीं है लेकिन आपने ये देखा होगा की जब Pakistan की तरफ से Afghanistan पर हमले किए गए तो किसी एक मुल्क ने भी उसकी मुज़म्मत नहीं की और इसके साथ ही फिर हम ये देखते हैं की जब दोनों की military का कंपैरिजन किया जाता है तो powerful military है Pakistan की जिसने अपने आप को हालात के जदी तारीन तकाज़ों के मुताबिक दुनिया की चौथी बड़ी military भारत से मुकाबला के लिए तैयार किया हुआ है यहां पे हमें देख रहे हैं की Pakistan technology के हवाले से Afghanistan से बहुत ज़्यादा advance है हमारे पास जिओ पॉलीटिकल लेवरेज है हमारे दोस्त मलिक हमारे पीछे आने के लिए तैयार है और इसके साथ ही अफगान रिफ्यूजी समेत ट्रांसिट trade Pakistan के बड़े advantage के अंदर शामिल होता है लेकिन दूसरी तरफ हम यह देख रहे हैं कि Pakistan के अंदर जो <strong>economy</strong> है वह बिल्कुल डूब चुकी है रसिया China Iran और India जो है वह अपने तौर पर इनको तस्लीम कर चुकी हैं रसिया ने इसको बहसित मुल्क तस्लीम कर लिया इनकी हुकूमत को खान तालिबान की बल्कि बकाया जो तीन मलिक हैं उन्होंने Afghanistan के अंदर अपने सफारत खाने को लिए हैं और इसके साथ ये हमें देखते हैं की health और education में ये system इनका बिल्कुल इंस्टीट्यूशंस कॉलेप्स कर चुके हैं पुरी दुनिया से ये तन्हा हुए हैं और इसके साथ ये मैं देख रहे हैं की उन के जो program चल रहे the funding बंद होने के बाद वहां पे बहुत ही बुरे हालत है क्यों क्योंकि अफगान तल बान ये समझते हैं की अपनी आवाम के हालत को ठीक करना उनकी ज़िम्मेदारी नहीं है अगर वो मार रहे हैं अगर वो भूखे मर रहे हैं अगर वो हर वक्त में है तो ये सब अल्लाह की मर्ज़ी है उसके लिए इन्हें कोशिश जो या परेशान होने की बिल्कुल भी ज़रूरत नहीं है और वो Pakistan से पढ़ डाला लेने के बाद चाहते ये है की fada लेने के बाद चाहते यह है की अपने वहां पे ये दिखा सके की वो Pakistan की प्रोक्सी नहीं वो Pakistan के पपेट नहीं और वो Pakistan से मुकाबला करके अपने अंदर ही अपने मुल्क के अंदर आवामी राय को अपने लिए बदलना चाहते हैं लेकिन ये मामला इतने आराम से हल होने वाला नहीं है अंदरूनी खाना जंगी की बहुत ज़्यादा इस वक्त खबरें आ रही है हक्कानी और कंधारी group आपस में आमने सामने आ चुके हैं बयानात एक दूसरे के खिलाफ दिए जा रहे हैं नाराज़गी का इज़हार किया जा रहा है और कई ऐसे ऐसे जो कि Pakistan के acid समझे जाते हैं वह इस वक्त मुकम्मल तौर पर यह कोशिश कर रहे हैं कि जो लोग भी इस मामलात को खराब करने की कोशिश करें इसको किसी भी तरीके से संभाला जाए और opposition मुजाहिद्दीन एन are f f यह तमाम के तमाम जो धड़े है anti तालमान वह इस वक्त मुथरिक हो रहे हैं और हम यह देखते हैं कि ना उनके पास air defense system है ना उनके पास कोई air force है ना उनके पास कोई रडार है और इसके बावजूद हम यह देख रहे हैं कि टीडीपी को अपने पुराने ताल्लुकात की वजह से अपनी आईडियोलॉजी की वजह से अपने social bond की वजह से यह आईएसआईएस के खड़ासा के डर से वहां पर इनको support कर रहे हैं और हम यह देखते हैं कि जितने भी anti Pakistan narrative्स है उनको डोमेस्टिक support के लिए इस्तेमाल किया जा रहा है इसके साथ ही हमें यह खबरें आना शुरू हो जाती हैं कि जनाब इस वक्त अफगान मुहाजरीन की बस्तियों को खाली करवा दिया गया है अफगान transit के जितने भी परमिट थे उनको cancel करवा दिया गया है कराची से लेकर कोटा तक सबको यह का दिया गया है कि कोई दो महीने नहीं है एक हफ्ते के अंदर अपना बोरिया बिस्तर गोल करें और तमाम अफगान मोहरी यहां से चले जाएं इतनी ज़्यादा एक pressure build हो चुका है इस वक्त Afghanistan के ऊपर और इसके साथ यह में देख रहे हैं कि 10000 गाड़ियां कंटेनर के साथ इस वक्त Pakistan के अंदर मौजूद है जून का समाज खराब हो सकता है और इसके साथ ही हमारे पास और भी बहुत सी ऐसी खबरें ए रही हैं जिसके मुताबिक Afghanistan एक बड़ी मुश्किल के अंदर फंसा हुआ है लेकिन हमें Afghanistan और Pakistan के रिलेशंस को और अफ़ग़ानिस्तान को समझने के लिए कुछ चीज़ों पर नज़र डालने की ज़रूरत है देखें बादशाह था अमरुल्लाह अफ़ग़ानिस्तान का 1928 में उससे एक हबीबुल्लाह बच्चा को के नाम से बचा को बेसिकली कहा जाता है एक पानी पिलाने वाले का बेटा यह वह सकता जो कि पहले फौज में था फिर यह डाकुओं के साथ मिल गया और उसके बाद इसको अंग्रेज़ों ने अपने मकासित के लिए इस्तेमाल किया शरीयत का निफ़ाज़ एक डाकू से करवाया और फिर हमने ये देखा की एक ताजी जो है वो अमन अल्लाह को शिकिस्ट देके 6 मा के लिए हुक्मरान वन गया उसके बाद हम ये देखते हैं की नादिशा वापस आती हैं और फिर उनके मरने के बाद उनका 12 साला बेटा जाहिर शाह जो है वो हुक्मरान बंता है यहां से खेल शुरू होता है और फिर उसके बाद Pakistan बंता है और जैसे ही Pakistan बनता है तो सबसे पहला खत अंग्रेज़ों को लिखा जाता है की जनाब ये जितने भी इलाके हैं पेशावर वाले ये या तो Afghanistan में शामिल कर दिए जाए या फिर इनको आज़ाद रियासत बना दिया जाए लेकिन वहां पे referendum होता है और सब Pakistan के हक में vote देते हैं और ये Pakistan के अंदर शामिल हो जाता है उसके बाद फिर Afghanistan यहां पे नहीं रुकता वो जाता है उन के अंदर और वो Pakistan की उन में शमोलिएत को challenge करता है इसके साथ ही फिर हम ये देखते हैं की 1955 में जलालाबाद काबुल और कंधार की अंबैसियों और conflict जो Pakistan के थे उन पर हमले किया जाते हैं Pakistan और Afghanistan के ताल्लुकात इतने खराब हो जाते हैं की 1961 तक हमारे सफर की ताल्लुकात बिल्कुल मून काटा हुए थे लेकिन उसके बाद शाह Iran की सालसी में ये मामलात जो है ते होते हैं फिर हम ये देखते हैं की चीज़ चलती हैं दौड़ खान जो है वो जाहिर शाह के खिलाफ बगावत कर देता है दौड़ शाह बेसिकली कजन था जाहिर शाह का और इसको पीएम लगाया था जाहिर शाह ने लेकिन फिर जब वो बगावत करता है और वो control ले लेता है तो भारत के साथ मिलकर दहशत गर्दी चाहे वो केपी के हो चाहे वो बलूचिस्तान हो वहां पे बहुत ज़्यादा दहशतगर्दी बढ़ जाती है हम ये देखते हैं की गवर्नर जो है याद शेरपा थे केपी के अंदर उनको कत्ल कर दिया जाता है और फिर उसके बाद भुट्टो मैदान में आते हैं और वह अपनी एक डिफाई policy बनाते हैं लेकिन इसी दौरान देखा जाता है कि रसिया 1978 में Afghanistan के अंदर आ जाता है और Afghanistan के ऊपर क़ब्ज़ा कर लेता है और उससे पहले हमने देखा था कि 1979 में रसिया है लेकिन 1978 में इंकलाब आ गया था और एक साल के अंदर अंदर दो सर बढ़ाने मुरिकल हो गए फिर जब यूएसएसआर आता है तो उसके बाद फिर मुजाहिदीन आते हैं मुजाहिदीन के अंदर Pakistan का role America का role पूरी दुनिया को पता है और फिर उसके बाद इस role के बाद 1989 के अंदर दोबारा मुजाहिदीन जो है वह अकूमत संभाल लेते हैं जब वह हकूमत में आती है तो Pakistan के साथ वह यही कुछ करते हैं जो कि आई तालिबान ने किया और फिर वह आपस में अपने एक किरदार की जंग और रस्साकशी के अंदर इस हद तक फंसते हैं की 1994 के अंदर Pakistan की मदद से तहरीक ए तालबान का आगाज किया जाता है और 1996 में तालबान Afghanistan के हुक्मरान वन जाते हैं और इसके साथ ही फिर हम यह देखते हैं कि 2001 के अंदर 911 होता है अमरीका आता है अमरीका के साथ ही अश्वनी हामिद कर्जई आता है भारत उनके साथ मिलकर काम करता है और फिर जब तालिबान वापस आते हैं America यानि कि 822000000000 dollar यहां पर 20 साल के अंदर खर्च करके गया 250 अमेरिकी फौजी जो है उसने यहां पर मरवाए लेकिन उसके बाद जाहिर सी बात है दूसरे की ज़मीन की दूसरे का मूल था वहां से उसको एक न एक दिन जाने ही था और दूसरी तरफ Pakistan को इस सारी शकीश का America ने ज़िम्मेदार करार दिया और Pakistan के साथ काफी अरसे तक जो है वो ताल्लुकात खराब रहे यही donald trump Pakistan के बारे में कहते थे की हमें Pakistan से सिर्फ और सिर्फ धोखा मिला है लेकिन वक्त का धारा अब फिर पलट चुका है और हम ये देख रहे हैं की चीज़ एक different direction में चल चुकी हैं या कई मामलात के अंदर तारीख अपने आप को दोहरा रही है लेकिन इस वक्त भारत का गोदी media मुकम्मल अफगान तालिबान को हिमायत कर रहा है वहां पे जो टैंक है रशियन टैंक उन टैंकों की फोटो बना के ये दिखाए जा रहा है की देखें जी ये Pakistan फौजियों से छीन गए हैं इसके साथ ही वहां पे ड्रामे बनाए जा रहे हैं और जाली character बना के Pakistan फौज के साथ वहां पे तालिबान जो है वो उसका मजाक उदा रहे हैं और ये भी नहीं काबुल के अंदर आपको पता है Pakistan के ने कंधार और काबुल पे attack किया air strike की और उसे air strike के बारे में आपको पता है की अफगान तालबन क्या कह रहे हैं की जनाब ये tank कर यहां पे फटा है जबकि Pakistan ने इसकी तस्दीक कर दी है और कहा जा रहा है कि जितने भी वहां पर टीडीपी के रहनुमा या उनके घर थे उनको वहां पर जो बमबारी की गई है वहां पर बहुत ज़्यादा जानी नुकसान सामने आया है लेकिन Pakistan यह बाजियां कर चुका है कि जो भी दहशतगर्दों के साथ रहेगा उनकी सहूलियतकारी करेगा उनका पहरा देगा वह फिर कोलैटरल damage में नहीं आएगा वह उनका सहूलियत car ही समझा जाएगा और इसके साथ यह में देखते हैं कि चीन ने इसका खैर मद्धम किया है यू एन की report आ चुकी है आपको मैं बता दूं एक तरफ हमने मैं 45 से 50 ख्वारजी मारे हैं मोहम्मद के करीब लेकिन दूसरी तरफ हमें देख रहे हैं कि यूएन की report आ चुकी है और वो ये का रही है की जनाब यहां पे तालिबान ने खुली छूट दी हुई है दहशतगर्दों को अलकायदा को और दिगर को और उनको एताद करने की इजाज़त दी जा रही है और यहां पे बस्ती Asia और दिगर मुमलिक के सलामती को Afghanistan से बहुत ज़्यादा खतरा है अलकायदा की मौजूदगी का ताल्लुक इस तरीके से लगाया जा रहा है की वहां पे अब नजाद जंगजू भी मौजूद हैं और तालिबान के साथ मिलकर मांझी में ये जंग लड़ते रहे हैं और ये जंगजू अफ़ग़ानिस्तान के गजनी सुबह हलमंद कंधार arjgaan और जाबुल में फैले हुए हैं और अलकायदा से मुंशी कई तरबियती मराकेश भी मौजूद है और तीन नए तरबियती मुराकेश जो है वो अलकायदा और टीडीपी के दहशत गर्दा को वहां पे तरबियत दी जा रही है 6000 जंगजु की टीपी के हैं जबकि 2000 से ज़्यादा जंगजु है वो आईएसआईएस खरासा के मौजूद है लेकिन इसी सारी मालूमात के दरमियान में हमें ये पता चलता है की कतर entry मारता है और वहां के कहता है की मैं आपकी सुला करवाना चाहता हूं मैं ये नहीं चाहता की आप दो मुस्लिम मलिक आपस में जंग करें तो Pakistan ने कतर को ये कह दिया है की हमने तो समझने की पुरी कोशिश कर ली हमारे भी बहुत ज़्यादा resources हैं अफ़ग़ानिस्तान में हमने ही इन्हीं सांपों को दूध पीला पीला के जवान की है अगर आप कोई कोशिश कर सकते हैं तो आप अगले 48 घंटे में कर लें लेकिन इस वक्त जो खबरें में आ रही है की सरहद के ऊपर तमाम तर जंगी साजो समान बिछा दिया गया है और हम पुरी तैयारी में है किसी भी जारी का मुंह तोड़ जवाब देने के लिए
